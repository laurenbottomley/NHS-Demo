                <h1>Pillars of the National Honor Society</h1>
                <br>
                <h5>Overview</h5>
                <p>National Honor Society is more than an honor roll. The objective of the Capeside High School chapter of NHS is to recognize and foster enthusiasm for scholarship, to promote the development of strong character, to encourage positive leadership, and to cultivate responsible citizenship through service to school and community. These four principles shape the organization’s activities and are reflected in the member's’ responsibilities.</p>
                <p>To remain a CHS NHS member in good standing, students must:</p>
                <ul id = "requirements">
                    <li>maintain a gpa of 3.5 or higher</li>
                    <li>act as a positive role model and representative of Capeside High School</li>
                    <li>maintain excellence in integrity in leadership, scholarship, character, and service</li>
                    <li>attend all NHS meetings</li>
                    <li>participate in an additional 30 hours of community service before graduation</li>
                </ul>
                <p id = "member"><strong>Note for current members: </strong>A member is never automatically dismissed for failing to maintain standards.  But members should understand that they are liable for dismissal if they do not maintain the standards of scholarship, leadership, service, and character that were used as the basis for their selection.  They should also be informed that they are allowed limited warnings during their membership but that in the case of a flagrant violation of school rules or civil laws, a warning is not necessarily required.  Furthermore, a student who is dismissed or who resigns may never again become an Honor Society member.<p>

                        <p><strong>Scholarship</strong></p>
                        <p>Scholarship is characterized by a commitment to learning. A student is willing to spend the necessary time to cultivate his/her mind in the quest for knowledge. This pillar can only be achieved through diligence and effort. Scholarship means always doing the best work possible, regardless of impending reward.</p>

                    <p><strong>Service</strong></p>
                    <p>Service is generally considered to be those actions taken by the student which are done with or on behalf of others without any direct financial or material compensation to the individual performing the service.

                    <p><strong>Leadership</strong></p>
                    <p>The leadership criterion is considered highly important for membership selection. Leadership is easiest shown in terms of the number of offices held in school or community organizations. However, it is important to recognize that leadership also exists outside elected positions including effective participation in other co-curricular activities offered on campus. Leadership roles in both the school and community may be considered, provided they can be verified.</p>
