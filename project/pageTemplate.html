                    <p>The National Honor Society (NHS) is the nation's premier organization established to recognize outstanding high school students. More than just an honor roll, NHS serves to honor those students who have demonstrated excellence in the areas of Scholarship, Leadership, Service, and Character. These characteristics have been associated with membership in the organization since its beginning in 1921.<br>Chapter membership not only recognizes students for their accomplishments, but challenges them to develop further through active involvement in school activities and community service.<br>NHS membership is a privilege bestowed upon students by the Faculty of the school, and not considered a right inherent to any student. Membership is granted only to those students selected by the Faculty Council on the condition of their having met the standards for selection based upon: scholarship, leadership, character and service.

                        The National Honor Society ranks as one of the most prestigious organizations for high school students.  At Capeside High School, our chapter is more than just a collection of students who have reached a high grade point average.  They are academically excellent students who are dedicated to service in the community, leaders through involvement in school activities, and young men and women who demonstrate exceptional character.<br>
                        Selection to the National Honor Society is a privilege, and not a right.  Students do not apply for membership; instead, they provide information to be used by the selection committee to support their candidacy for membership.  The Capeside High School chapter is composed of juniors and seniors who have satisfied the following requirements:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Scholarship:</strong> Candidates must have earned a 3.5 cumulative grade point average. This is calculated from first semester, 9th grade through 1st semester 11th grade.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Candidates should hold school offices or other positions of responsibility; be leaders in the classroom, in extra-curricular activities, and/or at work; participate in the classroom, in extra-curricular activities, and/or at work; demonstrate a continuous commitment to any responsibility accepted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service:</strong> Candidates will participate in community activities or actions that are done with or on behalf of others without direct financial or material compensation. Whatever service they participate in they should be dependable, willing to sacrifice to offer assistance, and cheerfully and enthusiastically offer their time and energy. Candidates are required to complete 50 hours of community service by the end of the 1st semester of their junior year. This needs to be documented on a Community Service Form.</li>
                        <li><strong>Character:</strong> Candidates will demonstrate excellence of character in their actions. They will represent the school and community in a positive manner that is worthy of this prestigious honor. Character is demonstrated through the following six qualities: respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, fairness, caring, and citizenship.</li>
